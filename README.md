# hello-world
My first GitHub repository...
ZoolanderMicro (where small ideas are a big deal) started as a company name to add on order forms. With some suppliers, I would user Maker's Dozen as an identity. Though I am an active Maker, I really like the concept of ZoolanderMicro because I have so many small ideas. So, in contribution to the Maker Verse, I will be posting my projects here, the new home of ZoolanderdMicro.
